# Main.InventoryLayout

Inventory layouts from a form's `inventory` field: checked against the inventory and filled from the bank, rune pouch included.

```luau
local InventoryLayout = require("@lib/main/inventory_layout")
```

The user builds layouts per script on the loader's Inventory tab, read from the client with the rune pouch's runes; the form's `inventory` field picks one (see `Host.form` in [Host](../host.md)). A layout is positional, but the bank cares about amounts: a stack's range, or the number of copies of a non-stacking item. An item is its `ids`, or for dose/charge items its accepted `doses` (see [LayoutItem](layout_item.md)), so four `Prayer potion(4)` slots accepting doses 4 and 3 want four potions of either dose.

A field's `required` items appear padlocked in every layout (`locked = true`); the user can move but not change them. A layout without room for them can't be picked.

```luau
local Host = require("@lib/host")
local Bankmain = require("@lib/main/interfaces/mainscreen/bankmain")
local InventoryLayout = require("@lib/main/inventory_layout")

local values = Host.form({
	title = "Herblore",
	fields = {
		{ id = "inventory", kind = "inventory", label = "Inventory", required = { { ids = { 227 }, slot = 0 } } },
	},
})
local layout = values and values.inventory
if layout and Bankmain.open() and InventoryLayout.withdraw(layout) then
	Bankmain.close()
	InventoryLayout.reorder(layout)
end
```

## Constants

Definition:
```luau
InventoryLayout.SIZE = 28
InventoryLayout.POUCH_TIMEOUT_MS = 2500
InventoryLayout.POLL_MS = 50
```
Inventory size; how long to wait for withdrawn runes to reach the pouch ([Runepouch](interfaces/mainscreen/runepouch.md)); poll interval.

## Types

Definition:
```luau
export type Layout = Host.InventoryLayout
export type Slot = Host.InventoryLayoutSlot
export type Rune = Host.LayoutItem
export type Entry = {
	items: { Item.Item },
	stackable: boolean,
	min: number,
	max: number,
	copies: number,
	label: string,
}
```
A layout is `{ name, slots, pouch? }`: filled slots (`LayoutItem`s with `slot`) and the pouch's runes when it holds a pouch. An `Entry` is one item as the bank sees it: accepted items in withdraw order, its stack range, and how many slots want it.

## InventoryLayout.from_client

Definition:
```luau
function InventoryLayout.from_client(name: string?): Layout?
```
A layout of the current inventory and pouch runes. Nil when the inventory can't be read. `stackable` is only known for stacks over one, which want exactly what they hold.

Example:
```luau
local layout = InventoryLayout.from_client("current")
```

## InventoryLayout.entries

Definition:
```luau
function InventoryLayout.entries(layout: Layout): { Entry }
```
The layout grouped by item: slots wanting the same thing are one entry, `copies` the slot count.

Example:
```luau
for _, e in ipairs(InventoryLayout.entries(layout)) do
	print(e.label, e.copies)
end
```

## InventoryLayout.matches

Definition:
```luau
function InventoryLayout.matches(layout: Layout): boolean?
```
Whether the inventory holds the layout, ignoring slots: each stack in range (both ends 0 means any nonzero amount), enough copies of everything else counting all accepted doses, and pouch runes in range (over `max` is fine, since the pouch can't return part of a stack). Nil when the inventory can't be read.

Example:
```luau
if InventoryLayout.matches(layout) then
	Bankmain.close()
end
```

## InventoryLayout.deposit_diff

Definition:
```luau
function InventoryLayout.deposit_diff(layout: Layout): boolean
```
With the bank open, deposits everything not in the layout (unaccepted doses included) and any excess: stacks over `max` and copies past the count, last-accepted doses first. True when all of it went in.

Example:
```luau
InventoryLayout.deposit_diff(layout)
```

## InventoryLayout.withdraw

Definition:
```luau
function InventoryLayout.withdraw(layout: Layout): boolean
```
With the bank open, makes the inventory match: `deposit_diff`, fill the pouch, then withdraw what is missing (a stack under `min` up to `max`, all of it when both are 0 and none is held; missing copies in accepted-dose order). True when the layout matches at the end.

Everything unlisted is deposited, so wear an equipment layout first (`EquipmentLayout.prepare`). The pouch is withdrawn if not carried, its bank panel opened (`BankPouch.open`), runes withdrawn into it (`BankPouch.withdraw`) and the panel dismissed; an already-open panel is dismissed first. Amounts the 1/5/10 buttons can't give that several items share are taken first so the X button is set once; a one-off amount uses `Withdraw-X` from the menu (see `Bankmain.withdraw`). A last non-stacking item that fills the free slots is left-clicked when the selected quantity covers it (`Bankmain.withdraw_selected`).

Example:
```luau
if Bankmain.open() and not InventoryLayout.withdraw(layout) then
	print("bank is missing items")
end
```

## InventoryLayout.reorder

Definition:
```luau
function InventoryLayout.reorder(layout: Layout): boolean
```
Drags items into the layout's slots from the first slot on, with the inventory tab open; a slot already holding an accepted item is left alone. True when every item sits in its slot; false when a wanted item isn't in the inventory outside the slots already holding it.

Example:
```luau
InventoryLayout.reorder(layout)
```
